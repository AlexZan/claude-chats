Quickly find conversations with full-text search across conversation titles and content. Search results are highlighted and scoped to the current project for fast, relevant results.

## Why Claude Chats?

### The Problem
Working with Claude Code generates many conversations, but Claude Code doesn't provide built-in tools to:
- **Rename conversations** - they all show as generic titles based on first message
- Find that conversation where you solved a specific problem
- Keep track of which projects have active discussions
- Clean up old or completed conversations

### The Solution
**Claude Chats is the first and only extension that truly renames Claude Code conversations.** Unlike other tools that only change display names in their own UI, Claude Chats:

‚úÖ **Modifies actual conversation data** in Claude Code's `.jsonl` files
‚úÖ **Changes persist in Claude Code** - not just in this extension
‚úÖ **Works everywhere** - renamed conversations show with new titles throughout VS Code
‚úÖ **Plus archiving and organization** - complete conversation management

This is the real deal - actual data modification, not cosmetic changes.

## How It Works (Technical Details)

### True Rename - Not Just Display Names

**Important:** This extension modifies the actual `.jsonl` conversation files that Claude Code uses. When you rename a conversation:

1. **Reads the `.jsonl` file** - Your conversation data in Claude Code's format
2. **Finds the first user message** - Claude Code uses this as the conversation title
3. **Modifies the message content** - Changes the actual data
4. **Writes back to the file** - Updates the `.jsonl` file
5. **Creates automatic backup** - Saves `.jsonl.backup` before any changes

**This means:**
- ‚úÖ Renames persist in Claude Code's native interface
- ‚úÖ Changes appear in Claude Code's conversation list
- ‚úÖ New titles show everywhere VS Code displays the conversation
- ‚úÖ No orphaned messages or hacks - clean data modification
- ‚ö†Ô∏è This is a workaround until Anthropic adds official rename support

### Archive Implementation

- Moves `.jsonl` file to `~/.claude/projects/_archive/[project-name]/`
- Optionally adds ‚úì prefix to mark as done
- Only allows archiving if conversation is not currently open
- VS Code no longer shows it in conversation list

### File Safety

- Always creates `.backup` files before modification
- Validates JSON structure before writing
- Handles file locks gracefully
- Atomic operations where possible

## Known Issues

See [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/yourusername/claude-chats/issues) for current known issues.

## Release Notes

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for detailed release notes.

### 0.1.0

Initial release of Claude Chats:
- Conversation tree view with project/date grouping
- Rename conversations with validation
- Archive and restore functionality

## Disclaimer

This extension modifies Claude Code conversation files (`.jsonl` format) to provide rename functionality. Automatic backups are created before modifications. This is an unofficial workaround until Anthropic adds native rename support. Use at your own risk - you are responsible for your data.
