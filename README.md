# Claude Chats

**Organize, rename, and archive your Claude Code conversations**

Never lose track of your AI conversations again. Claude Chats brings powerful conversation management directly into VS Code, helping you stay organized as you work with Claude Code.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Legal Disclaimer

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**

This extension directly modifies Claude Code conversation files (`.jsonl` format). While we take precautions:

- ‚úÖ **Automatic backups** are created before any modification (`.jsonl.backup` files)
- ‚úÖ Backups can be disabled in settings if desired
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **This is a hacky solution** - we're directly editing conversation files
- ‚ö†Ô∏è We try our best to stay compatible with Claude Code's format
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No guarantees** if Anthropic makes breaking changes to the file format
- ‚ö†Ô∏è The extension may stop working after Claude Code updates

**Why this approach?**
This extension provides rename and management capabilities that Claude Code doesn't officially support yet. It's a workaround until Anthropic decides to add these features officially.

**Recommendations:**
- Keep backups enabled (default)
- Don't modify conversations that are currently open
- Test on non-critical conversations first
- Keep your `.jsonl.backup` files safe

By using this extension, you accept that you are responsible for any data loss or corruption that may occur.

## How It Works

### Rename Implementation

- Modifies the first user message directly in the `.jsonl` file
- No orphaned messages or `parentUuid: null` tricks
- Creates backup before modification
- Updates VS Code's conversation cache automatically

### Archive Implementation

- Moves `.jsonl` file to `~/.claude/projects/_archive/[project-name]/`
- Optionally adds ‚úì prefix to mark as done
- Only allows archiving if conversation is not currently open
- VS Code no longer shows it in conversation list

### File Safety

- Always creates `.backup` files before modification
- Validates JSON structure before writing
- Handles file locks gracefully
- Atomic operations where possible
