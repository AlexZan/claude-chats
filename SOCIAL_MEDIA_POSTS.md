ðŸŽ‰ Excited to announce the launch of Claude Chats!

After working extensively with Claude Code, I noticed a major pain point: no way to rename or organize conversations. They all just pile up with generic titles based on the first message.

So I built the first VS Code extension that actually solves this problem.

What makes Claude Chats different?
â€¢ **True data modification** - Edits the actual .jsonl conversation files
â€¢ **Persists in Claude Code** - Not just a cosmetic UI change
â€¢ **Complete management** - Rename, archive, organize, and delete
â€¢ **Safe operations** - Automatic backups before any changes

This is an unofficial workaround until Anthropic adds native support. If you use Claude Code daily and struggle with conversation management, check it out!

Available now on the VS Code Marketplace.

**Title:** [Extension] Claude Chats - First extension to truly rename Claude Code conversations

```
Hey everyone! I just published my first VS Code extension and wanted to share it with the community.

**The Problem:**
If you use Claude Code, you know that conversations pile up quickly and there's no way to rename them or organize them. They all show generic titles based on the first message, making it hard to find what you need.

**The Solution:**
I built **Claude Chats** - the first extension that actually modifies the .jsonl conversation data to rename conversations. This isn't just a cosmetic change in a separate UI - the renamed conversations persist in Claude Code itself everywhere they appear.

**Features:**
- âœ… True conversation renaming (modifies actual .jsonl files)
- âœ… Archive old conversations
- âœ… Organize by project or date
- âœ… Delete unwanted conversations
- âœ… Automatic backups before any modifications
- âœ… Complete tree view for browsing all conversations

**Technical Details:**
The extension works by modifying the first user message in the .jsonl file (which Claude Code uses as the conversation title). It's a workaround until Anthropic adds official rename support, but it works really well.

**Safety:**
Automatic backups are created before any modifications (.jsonl.backup files), so your data is protected.

## Hacker News Post

**Title:** Show HN: Claude Chats â€“ First VS Code extension to rename Claude Code conversations

```
Hi HN,

I built a VS Code extension that solves a problem I ran into while using Claude Code: there's no way to rename or organize conversations.

Claude Code uses .jsonl files to store conversations, and the title shown in the UI comes from the first user message. My extension modifies this data directly, so renamed conversations persist everywhere in VS Code - not just in a separate UI.

Features:
- Rename conversations (modifies actual .jsonl data)
- Archive old conversations
- Organize and filter
- Automatic backups

It's an unofficial workaround until Anthropic adds native support, but it's been working well for me. Automatic backups protect against data loss.

Technical approach: The extension reads the .jsonl file, finds the first user message, modifies it, and writes it back with a backup. Simple but effective.

Happy to answer questions!
