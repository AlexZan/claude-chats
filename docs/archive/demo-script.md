# Claude Chats - Demo GIF Script

This script outlines the steps for creating animated GIF demos of Claude Chats for the VS Code marketplace and README.

## Setup

**Duration Target**: 5-8 seconds per GIF (keep them short and focused)
**Recording Tool**: Windows 11 Snipping Tool (Win + Shift + S ‚Üí Record tab)
**Output**: Save directly as GIF from Snipping Tool
**Window Selection**: Free-hand rectangle around the relevant VS Code area

## Strategy: 3 Focused Mini-GIFs

Since you can't set exact window sizes and must free-hand draw, create **3 short, focused GIFs** that showcase key features. This avoids flooding the README while showing all important functionality.

### Rectangle Drawing Tips
1. **Practice the area first** - hover your mouse to visualize the rectangle
2. **Include padding** - Leave ~20px around the edges
3. **Keep consistent** - Try to draw similar-sized rectangles for all 3 GIFs
4. **Focus on sidebar** - Capture Claude Chats panel + small editor area for context

## Pre-Recording Checklist

- [ ] Close unnecessary VS Code panels (terminal, output, etc.)
- [ ] Set VS Code theme to a popular one (Dark+ or similar)
- [ ] Ensure 8-12 Claude Code conversations exist
- [ ] Have at least 1 conversation archived
- [ ] Clear any personal/sensitive information from conversation titles
- [ ] Set zoom level for readability (Ctrl/Cmd + = a few times)
- [ ] Position Claude Chats view prominently in sidebar

## Alternative: Single Combined GIF (If You Want Just One)

If you prefer ONE comprehensive GIF instead of three:

### GIF: Quick Feature Tour (10-12 seconds)
**Filename**: `demo-features.gif`

1. **Draw rectangle** around: Claude Chats sidebar only (narrow, ~400px)
2. **Action sequence**:
   - Show conversation list (1s)
   - Click search ‚Üí type ‚Üí show results (2s)
   - Clear search (0.5s)
   - Right-click ‚Üí rename conversation (2s)
   - Right-click ‚Üí archive (1.5s)
   - Show archived section (0.5s)
   - Right-click ‚Üí restore (1.5s)
   - Final hover over list (1s)

**This combines search, rename, and archive in one flowing demo** - good for marketplace hero image.

## Recording Tips for Windows 11 Snipping Tool

1. **Practice the rectangle**: Hover and visualize before drawing
2. **Consistent size**: Try to draw similar rectangles for all 3 GIFs
3. **Include padding**: Leave ~20px margins around content
4. **Practice actions**: Do 2-3 dry runs before recording
5. **Slow and steady**: Deliberate cursor movements
6. **Pause at results**: Give viewers time to see changes
7. **No mistakes**: Re-record if you misclick - these are SHORT so it's quick

### Snipping Tool Workflow

```
Win + Shift + S
‚Üí Click "Record" tab
‚Üí Click "New"
‚Üí Draw rectangle around capture area
‚Üí Click "Start" button
‚Üí Perform your demo actions
‚Üí Click "Stop" button
‚Üí Use trim tool to cut dead time
‚Üí Click "Save as" ‚Üí Choose GIF format
```

## File Naming & Organization

Save your GIFs as:
- `demo-search-rename.gif` (GIF #1)
- `demo-archive.gif` (GIF #2)
- `demo-viewer.gif` (GIF #3)
- OR `demo-features.gif` (single combined version)

**Target file size**: Under 3MB each (Snipping Tool optimizes automatically)

## How to Use in README.md

### Option A: 3 Focused GIFs (Recommended)

```markdown
## Features

### üîç Lightning-Fast Search
![Search and Rename Demo](demo-search-rename.gif)

Search across all conversations instantly and rename them with true file modification.

### üì¶ Archive Management
![Archive Demo](demo-archive.gif)

Keep your workspace organized by archiving old conversations and restoring them when needed.

### üëÅÔ∏è Beautiful Viewer
![Viewer Demo](demo-viewer.gif)

```

### Option B: Single Hero GIF

```markdown
## Features

![Claude Chats Features](demo-features.gif)

- üîç **Fast Search** - Find any conversation instantly
- ‚úèÔ∏è **True Rename** - Modify actual .jsonl files
- üì¶ **Archive** - Organize your conversation history
- ‚ö° **Lightning Fast** - Faster than native Claude Code
```

**Recommendation**: Use **Option A (3 GIFs)** - it's more engaging and doesn't flood the README since each GIF is focused and short.

## Merging Multiple GIFs (If Needed)

If you want to combine the 3 GIFs into one later, you can use:

**Online Tools**:
- **ezgif.com/maker** - Upload multiple GIFs, set delays, merge
- **gifmaker.me** - Combine GIFs vertically or horizontally

**Command Line** (if you have ffmpeg):
```bash
# Stack vertically
ffmpeg -i demo-search-rename.gif -i demo-archive.gif -i demo-viewer.gif -filter_complex vstack=inputs=3 combined.gif

# Stack horizontally (if they're similar height)
ffmpeg -i demo-search-rename.gif -i demo-archive.gif -filter_complex hstack combined.gif
```

**Note**: For README, keeping them separate is better for loading and readability.
