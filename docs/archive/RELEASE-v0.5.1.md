# Release v0.5.1 - Claude Chats Menu

## 🎉 Enhanced: Status Bar Button → Full Action Menu

Version 0.5.1 upgrades the status bar button from a simple rename button to a comprehensive action menu!

### What's New

**💬 Claude Chats Menu Button**
- Status bar now shows "💬 Claude Chats" with full action menu
- Access 5 quick actions without opening sidebar
- State-aware menu items (Archive/Restore, Done/Undone)
- Same smart detection (80%+ success rate)

**Menu Actions:**
1. ✏️ **Rename** - Change conversation title
2. ✓ **Mark as Done/Undone** - Toggle completion status
3. 📦 **Archive/Restore** - Move to/from archive (state-aware)
4. 📋 **Export to Markdown** - Save conversation as .md file
5. 🗑️ **Delete** - Permanently remove conversation

---

## Comparison

### v0.5.0 (Previous)
- Button: `$(edit) Rename`
- Action: Direct rename only
- Limited to one function

### v0.5.1 (New)
- Button: `$(comment-discussion) Claude Chats`
- Action: Full menu with 5 options
- Complete conversation management from status bar

---

## How It Works

**User Flow:**
1. Open Claude Code chat → Status bar shows "💬 Claude Chats"
2. Click button → Menu appears with available actions
3. Select action → Executes immediately
4. Switch to other file → Button disappears

**Smart Features:**
- Menu items adapt to conversation state
- Shows "Archive" or "Restore" based on archived status
- Shows "Mark as Done" or "Mark as Undone" based on title
- All actions use same smart detection as before

---

## Technical Implementation

### New Components

**Helper Method** - `detectOrSelectConversation()` in ConversationManager
- Centralizes conversation detection logic
- Reduces code duplication
- Used by both menu and command palette

**Menu Command** - `showClaudeChatsMenu`
- Builds state-aware menu items
- Routes to existing action methods
- Preserves all existing functionality

**Updated Status Bar**
- Changed command from `renameCurrentConversation` to `showClaudeChatsMenu`
- Updated button text and icon
- Same visibility logic (Claude Code chat detection)

### Code Changes

**Modified Files:**
- `src/conversationManager.ts` - Added `detectOrSelectConversation()` helper
- `src/extension.ts` - Added `showClaudeChatsMenu` command, updated status bar
- `package.json` - Version bump to 0.5.1
- `README.md` - Updated documentation with menu feature

**Lines Added:** ~75 lines (menu command + helper method)
**Lines Removed:** 0 (fully backward compatible)

## User Benefits

### Before v0.5.1
To perform multiple actions on a conversation:
1. Rename → Click button → Enter title → Close tab → Reopen
2. Mark as Done → Open sidebar → Find conversation → Right-click → Toggle
3. Archive → Open sidebar → Find conversation → Right-click → Archive
4. Export → Open sidebar → Find conversation → Right-click → Export

**Multiple context switches, many clicks**

### After v0.5.1
All actions from one menu:
1. Click "Claude Chats" → Select action → Done!

**One menu, all actions** 🎉

---

## Compatibility

- ✅ **Fully backward compatible** - All existing features work
- ✅ **No breaking changes** - Tree view, command palette unchanged
- ✅ **Same settings** - `showStatusBarButton` still works
- ✅ **Same detection logic** - 80%+ success rate maintained

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Tab Title Caching:** After renaming, close and reopen chat tab to see updated title (Claude Code caching, same as v0.5.0)
2. **Detection Fallback:** If conversation can't be auto-detected, shows conversation picker first, then menu (expected behavior)
3. **Confirmation Dialogs:** Archive and Delete still show confirmation prompts (safety feature)

---

## Upgrade Instructions

### From v0.5.0

1. Update extension via VS Code Marketplace
2. Reload VS Code (if needed)
3. Open a Claude Code chat
4. Look for "💬 Claude Chats" button (same location, new label)
5. Click it → See the new menu!

**No configuration changes needed.**

### Settings

The existing setting still works:
- **`claudeChats.showStatusBarButton`** - Toggle menu button on/off

---

## Testing

All features tested and working:

✅ Menu displays correctly with all 5 options
✅ Rename action works (with reload reminder)
✅ Toggle Done/Undone works
✅ Archive/Restore works (state-aware)
✅ Export to Markdown works
✅ Delete works (with confirmation)
✅ State-aware labels (Done vs Undone, Archive vs Restore)
✅ Smart detection works (80%+ direct menu)
✅ Fallback picker works when needed
✅ No regression in tree view actions
✅ No regression in command palette
✅ Settings toggle works
