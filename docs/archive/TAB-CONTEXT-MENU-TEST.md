## What Was Added

Right-click functionality on editor tabs to access Claude Chats menu!

### Implementation

Added `editor/title/context` menu contribution that shows "Claude Chats" menu item when you right-click any editor tab.

---

## How to Test

### Setup
1. Press `F5` to launch Extension Development Host
2. Open multiple tabs (regular files + Claude Code chat)

### Test Case 1: Right-Click on Claude Code Chat Tab
1. Open a Claude Code chat
2. **Right-click on the tab** (not in the editor, but on the tab itself)
3. **Expected:** "Claude Chats" menu item appears in context menu
4. Click it → Menu opens with 5 actions
5. Select an action → Works correctly

### Test Case 2: Right-Click on Regular File Tab
1. Open a regular file (e.g., .ts, .md file)
2. **Right-click on the tab**
3. **Expected:** "Claude Chats" menu item appears
4. Click it → Shows conversation picker (fallback behavior)
   - This is expected since it's not a Claude Code chat

### Test Case 3: Right-Click on .jsonl File Tab
1. Open a `.jsonl` conversation file directly
2. **Right-click on the tab**
3. **Expected:** "Claude Chats" menu item appears
4. Click it → Detects the conversation immediately
5. Menu shows with correct conversation actions

## Expected Behavior

### For Claude Code Chat Tabs
- ✅ Menu item appears in tab context menu
- ✅ Clicking it triggers smart detection
- ✅ Opens Claude Chats menu (80%+ success rate)
- ✅ All actions work correctly

### For Regular Tabs
- ✅ Menu item still appears (can't filter by tab type in when clause)
- ✅ Falls back to conversation picker
- ✅ User can still select a conversation

### For .jsonl File Tabs
- ✅ Direct detection works
- ✅ Opens menu for that specific conversation

---

## User Experience

**New Way to Access Claude Chats Menu:**
1. Status bar button (when chat is active)
2. Right-click on tab (any tab)
3. Command palette

**Benefits:**
- More discoverable (users naturally right-click tabs)
- Works even if status bar button is disabled
- Consistent with VS Code UX patterns

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Menu appears on all tabs** - Can't filter by webview type in when clause
   - This is a VS Code API limitation
   - Not a big issue: fallback picker works fine

2. **Tab detection** - When right-clicking a tab, VS Code passes the URI
   - For Claude Code chats (webviews): No URI, uses active tab detection
   - For .jsonl files: Direct detection via URI
   - For other files: Fallback to picker

---

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Menu item appears in tab context menu
- ✅ Works with Claude Code chat tabs
- ✅ Works with .jsonl file tabs
- ✅ Graceful fallback for regular tabs
- ✅ No errors or crashes
- ✅ Consistent with existing behavior

## Next Steps

If working correctly:
1. This is already good to go!
2. Update README to mention right-click on tabs
3. Could ship as v0.5.2 (minor enhancement)

If issues found:
- Document the issue
- Consider removing if too intrusive
- Or add when clause to limit visibility
